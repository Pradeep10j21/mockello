## 🛠️ Backend Setup (FastAPI)

The backend handles authentication, database interactions, and business logic.

1. **Navigate to the root directory.**
2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```
   *Alternatively, run `start_backend.bat` on Windows to auto-install and start.*
4. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```
   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## 💻 Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

The frontend provides the user interface for all four roles.

1. **Navigate to the root directory.**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
